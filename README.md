# Overview

A dashboard application to explore geospatial data using interactive
tables, web maps, and charts. map.landscape is developed using the
<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com" target="_blank">Shiny</a> framework.
It uses <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org" target="_blank">dplyr</a>
for data processing and
<a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/" target="_blank">sf</a> for
handling spatial data.

The motivation to develop map.landscape was to quickly explore and sync
data collected using
<a href="https://qfield.org" target="_blank">QField</a> mobile GIS.
However, it supports spatial and non-spatial data in GeoPackage files
and is relevant for a range of data exploration and visualisation use
cases.

  - Sync data collected using QField on different mobile devices.
  - Upload spatial and non-spatial tabular data as GeoPackage or zip
    files.
  - Explore data in interactive tables (using
    <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/" target="_blank">DataTables</a>).
  - Combine tabular data using spatial and non-spatial joins.
  - Create summary tables.
  - Create and style web maps (using
    <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>).
  - Visualise data using different charts (using
    <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>).

# Context

map.landscape forms part of workflow developed by the
<a href="https://livelihoods-and-landscapes.com" target="_blank">ACIAR
Livelihoods and Landscapes</a> project to map agricultural landscapes
and record information about farm management and condition. This
workflow encompasses collecting geospatial data in the field using
QField mobile GIS, Express server-side apps to support collating data
collected on different mobile devices, and map.landscape for data
processing and visualisation. map.landscape also includes some helper
functions for characterising farm diversity.

This dashboard is currently being used to support the Ministry of
Agriculture, Food, Forests, and Fisheries monitoring of farms on the
island group of Vavaâ€™u in the Kingdom of Tonga. You can read about these
use cases
<a href="https://livelihoods-and-landscapes.com/use-case.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
